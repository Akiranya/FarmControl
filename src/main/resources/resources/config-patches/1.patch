[comment]
key=world-settings.default.profiles.proactive
comment=# These profiles are constantly run.

[add-field]
key=world-settings.default.profiles.reactive
body=#  - hard-nerf-animal-farms\n#  - freeze-animal-farms
comment=# These profiles only run when the server is performing poorly and are progressively undone as performance\n# improves (as defined under the reactive-mode-settings).\n#  * Note: It is generally preferable to ensure your server's performance doesn't degrade in the first place,\n#    rather than try to mitigate it. That said, there are some reasonable use cases for this mode, such as\n#    allowing your players to keep larger farms at the cost of nerfing them when performance begins to degrade.

key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings
before=exclusion-settings
comment=# These settings concern the reactive mode for triggering profile check / action cycles.

[add-field]
key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings.trigger-tps-threshold
value=18.0
comment=# Below what TPS should the reactive mode be triggered?

[add-field]
key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings.untrigger-tps-threshold
value=19.9
comment=# Above what TPS should the reactive mode be untriggered, and actions undone.

[add-section]
key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings.untrigger-settings
comment=# These settings concern how the plugin should handle undoing actions performed on mobs once the reactive mode has\n# been untriggered.

[add-field]
key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings.untrigger-settings.minimum-cycles-before-undo
value=10
comment=# How many cycles of the reactive mode being untriggered should have to pass before any actions are undone?

[add-field]
key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings.untrigger-settings.maximum-undos-per-cycle
value=40
comment=# At most how many mobs should have their actions undone per cycle?

[add-section]
key=world-settings.default.reactive-mode-settings.untrigger-settings.entity-undo-weight
comment=# How much should an entity contribute to the maximum-undos-per-cycle limit?\n#  * For example, if maximum-undos-per-cycle was 40 and the entity-undo-weight for villagers was 5, at most 8\n#    villagers could have their actions undone (since 5 * 8 = 40).\n#  * If an entity type is not specified, the value under default will be used.

comment=# These settings concern how we determine the TPS.\n#  * Only touch these settings if you know what you're doing.

[add-field]
key=tps-tracker-settings.collection-period
value=1200
comment=# Over how many ticks should we collect tick durations for calculating the TPS?\n#  * Setting this too high will make the TPS very slow to react to changes.\n#  * Setting this too low will make the TPS volatile.

[add-field]
key=tps-tracker-settings.trim-outliers-to-within
value=100.0
comment=# By how much (in percent) should we allow the tick durations we use to calculate the TPS vary from the average\n# tick duration.\n#  * This is used for smoothing the TPS; making sure it's not heavily affected by sudden large lag spikes, such as\n#    those caused by garbage collections or world-saves.\n#  * Setting this to 0 will mean your TPS will never change - don't do that.

[add-section]
key=paper-settings
comment=# These are additional settings that apply if you are using Paper as your server software.

[add-section]
key=paper-settings.mspt-tracker-settings
comment=# These settings concern how we determine the server's MSPT.\n#  * Only touch these settings if you know what you're doing.
